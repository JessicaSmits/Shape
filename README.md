# Shape
![shape]()
Shape is a program, in which you can create your own world. You'll need an Arduino for it to work and download [processing](https://processing.org/). You can check the code for yourself by downloading and running it. If you have an Arduino and want to experience it for yourself, read the install below


## Install
**Step 1. Upload "Standard Firmata" to your Arduino.**<br/>
File > examples > firmata > StandardFirmata. This way processing now knows how to read the arduino.
  
**Step 2. Set up your Arduino.**<br/>
I have: 3 push buttons on digital read 2, 3, 5 and 2 potmeters on analog read 0 and 1. The order doesn't matter. If you want to use different input numbers, this is possible, but you'll have to go to the sketch called: "ArduinoRead" and change the input there.

**Step 3. Run the code and enjoy!**
